You can turn **any blog into clean, useful notes automatically** with AI — but you have to use it the _right_ way.

Most people just paste text and say:

> “Summarize this.”

That produces garbage.

Here is the **professional workflow**.

# 🧠 The AI Note-Making Pipeline

## Step 1 — Give AI the right role

Always start with this:

```
You are a knowledge compressor.
Your job is to convert long articles into short, high-value notes
that I can review later and remember.
Do not summarize — extract insight.
```

This changes how the model behaves.

---

## Step 2 — Use this prompt

Paste your blog and then add:

```
Convert this article into:

1. Core ideas (max 10 bullets)
2. Mental models
3. Rules I can apply
4. Common mistakes
5. One-page cheat sheet
```

This forces structure.

---

## Step 3 — Ask for “forget-proof” notes

Then add:

```
Rewrite everything as if it is advice to my future self.
No fluff. No repetition. No marketing language.
```

Now the notes become usable.

# Example prompt you can save

```

Be concise but deep.

# Why this works

You are not asking for a summary.  
You are asking for **compressed intelligence**.

That’s how:

- engineers take notes
    
- researchers study
    
- investors learn
