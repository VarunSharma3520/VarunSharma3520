Here’s a clear explanation of **DuckDNS**

## 🦆 What is **DuckDNS**?

**DuckDNS** is a **free dynamic DNS (DDNS) service**.  
A DDNS service lets you map a domain name (like `yourname.duckdns.org`) to a **changing IP address** — ideal if your home internet IP changes frequently. You typically use it to:

✨ Point a domain name to a home server (e.g., Next-JS app, self-hosted services)  
✨ Automatically update your IP when it changes  
✨ Access your home services without paying for a static IP

It’s widely used in home labs, Raspberry Pis, and remote access setups. ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

➡️ It’s hosted on AWS infrastructure and is free to use. ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

## 🛡️ DuckDNS Privacy Policy (Official)

DuckDNS _does_ have a **Privacy Statement** (last updated Jan 28 2020) that covers how it handles user data. Here are the key points: ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

### ✔️ **What Data Is Collected**

– Login info if you sign in via social accounts (e.g., email, username) ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))  
– IP addresses and access tokens needed for the DDNS service to work ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))  
– Browser and usage info (cookies, device details) from visiting the website ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

These help run the service, update DNS records, and keep it operational.

### ✔️ **How It’s Used**

They use collected data to:

- Provide and maintain the DDNS service
    
- Personalize the user experience
    
- Operate and secure the service (analytics, fraud prevention)
    

They _don’t sell your personal info to third parties_. ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

### ✔️ **Sharing Data**

They may share data:

- With service providers who help run the site
    
- If required by law
    
- To detect/prevent abuse or illegal activity
    

Third parties (like analytics or hosting services) may also process some info. ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

### ✔️ **Data Retention**

User data (e.g., IPs, emails) is kept while your DNS entry is active and for about **one year after it’s no longer active**. ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

### ✔️ **Rights & Choices**

Under GDPR/CCPA, users can:  
✅ Request correction, deletion, or a copy of their personal data  
✅ Opt out of data collection  
Data subject requests go through DuckDNS support like [privacy@duckdns.org](mailto:privacy@duckdns.org). ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

### ✔️ **Security**

Data is stored on AWS with standard encryption and security controls. ([DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/pp.jsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Duck DNS - privacy policy"))

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **DuckDNS subdomains are sometimes flagged** by security tools because malicious actors _abuse free DDNS domains_, but that’s misuse by others — not the service itself doing harm. ([Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/duckdns-org?utm_source=chatgpt.com "duckdns.org"))
    
2. DuckDNS reliability has mixed community feedback; some users report outages or DNS quirks because it’s a free, small-scale project.
