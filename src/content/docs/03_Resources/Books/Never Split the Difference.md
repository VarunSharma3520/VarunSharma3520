# Open-Ended Questions
It is also known as **Calibrated Questions**

## Key Elements of this Technique:

**1. No Fixed Answers**

- Questions that can't be answered with simple "yes/no"
- Requires thoughtful, detailed responses

**2. Illusion of Control**

- Makes the respondent feel they're in charge
- They believe they're providing valuable information
- Creates psychological comfort

**3. Time Advantage**

- Buys thinking time for the questioner
- Forces the other party to engage deeply

**4. Information Gathering**

- Reveals the other side's perspective
- Uncovers hidden motivations/thoughts

**5. Subtle Control**

- While appearing to give power to respondent
- Actually constrains their thinking within questioner's framework
- They don't realize they're being guided

This is a **strategic questioning technique** used in negotiations to gather intelligence, build rapport, and maintain conversational control while making the other party feel heard and respected

# The Four Core Principles:
Principled Negotiation approach from the famous book "Getting to Yes" by Roger Fisher and William Ury

## 1. Separate People from Problems

- Distinguish emotions/personalities from the actual issue
- Avoid taking things personally

## 2. Focus on Interests, Not Positions

- Look beyond what people are asking for
- Understand _why_ they want it (their underlying needs/motivations)

## 3. Generate Win-Win Options

- Collaborate to create mutually beneficial solutions
- Expand the pie rather than divide it

## 4. Use Objective Criteria

- Establish fair standards to evaluate solutions
- Remove subjective bias from decision-making

# How Our Brain Makes Decisions 

## 1. What Are Cognitive Biases?

- Our brains have **over 150 built-in mental shortcuts** that cause us to think irrationally
- These aren't random mistakes—they **consistently trick** us into seeing things incorrectly
- They affect everyone, all the time, without us realizing it

## 2. Common Thinking Traps:

**🎯 Framing Effect**

- We react differently to the same choice depending on how it's presented
- _Example_: "90% success rate" sounds better than "10% failure rate"

**🎲 Prospect Theory**

- We take crazy risks to avoid certain losses
- _Example_: Betting big when we're losing money, even when it's illogical

**💔 Loss Aversion**

- Losing something feels TWICE as painful as gaining the same thing feels good
- _Example_: You'd work much harder to avoid losing $100 than to gain $100

## 3. The Two Minds Inside Your Brain:

**⚡ System 1 (Fast Brain)**

- Quick, automatic, emotional reactions
- Operates without effort (like breathing)

**🐢 System 2 (Slow Brain)**

- Deliberate, logical thinking
- Requires effort and concentration

**🔑 The Big Secret**: System 1 runs the show and often makes our "rational" decisions for us!

# Secret About Human Thinking 

**Most people believe we make decisions like this:**

1. We carefully analyze facts
2. We logically weigh pros and cons
3. We make rational choices

**But that's completely wrong.**

## How Our Brain REALLY Works

**System 1 (Emotional Brain)** = Fast, automatic, feeling-based **System 2 (Rational Brain)** = Slow, deliberate, logic-based

**The Shocking Truth:** System 1 is the boss, and System 2 is the employee who justifies whatever System 1 decides.

## Real-World Example: The Salary Negotiation

**What Actually Happens:**

1. **You ask emotionally smart questions** like "How am I supposed to do that with this budget?"
2. **System 1 kicks in:** The boss immediately _feels_ doubt about their offer
3. **System 2 follows:** The boss's logical brain starts finding reasons to justify that doubt
4. **Result:** They raise the offer, but they _believe_ it was their own logical decision

 
## Point to Ponder: The Power Move

**Instead of arguing logically** ("I deserve more because..."), **you trigger the right emotions** that will make their rational brain come up with the conclusion you want

## Framework for Creating Smart Questions
### 1. **The Calibrated Question Formula**

**Structure:** "How/What + Specific Context + Desired Outcome"

**Examples:**

- "How am I supposed to do that with the current budget?"
- "What would need to happen for us to meet this deadline?"
- "How do you see this impacting our team's workflow?"

### 2. **The 3 Key Question Types**

**🎯 Diagnostic Questions** (Gather Information)

- "How did you arrive at that number?"
- "What factors are most important to you in this decision?"
- "What would success look like for you?"

**💭 Perspective Questions** (Reframe Thinking)

- "How would you feel if [specific scenario] happened?"
- "What would your ideal outcome look like?"
- "What concerns do you have about [topic]?"

**🧭 Directional Questions** (Guide Toward Your Goal)

- "What would need to change for you to consider [your proposal]?"
- "How can we make this work within [your constraint]?"
- "What would be the best way to address [specific issue]?"

### 3. **The SMART Question Checklist**

**S** - **Specific**: Target exact issues, not vague topics **M** - **Meaningful**: Connect to their interests/concerns **A** - **Avoid yes/no**: Use "how," "what," "tell me about" **R** - **Revealing**: Designed to uncover hidden information **T** - **Tactical**: Serves your strategic objective

### 4. **The Emotional Trigger Matrix**

Before asking, consider:

- What **emotion** do I want to trigger? (doubt, curiosity, concern, excitement)
- What **mental model** do I want them to question?
- What **assumption** do I want them to re-examine?
