title: STM32 Family
description: A clean, text-based FAMILY TREE DIAGRAM of the STM32 microcontroller families
---


Perfect — here is a **clean, text-based FAMILY TREE DIAGRAM** of the **STM32 microcontroller families**, exactly how they are organized internally by STMicroelectronics.

This will help you **visually understand how all families relate** and where **your MCUs (F103 & WBA63)** fit.

If you want, I can also show you:

✅ **STM32 vs ESP32 vs Arduino family tree**
✅ **Full Arduino MCU family tree (AVR, SAM, ESP)**
✅ **How the chip naming works (F103 = what exactly?)**
✅ **Which family is best for your real project**

👉 Tell me:
**Are you designing: Motor control, IoT, power electronics, robotics, or smart home?**
