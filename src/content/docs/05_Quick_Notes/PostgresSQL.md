Here is the **complete PostgreSQL knowledge map** — from beginner to **FAANG-level backend engineer**.

If you master this, you can design **bank-grade, high-scale systems**.

# 🐘 PostgreSQL Basics (Foundation)

## 1️⃣ What PostgreSQL Is

PostgreSQL is:

> An **ACID-compliant, relational, transactional database**

Used for:

- SaaS
    
- Banking
    
- AI products
    
- Analytics
    
- Fintech
    
- Marketplaces
    

---

## 2️⃣ Tables & Rows

```
users
| id | email | password | created_at |
```

Concepts:

- Primary key
    
- Foreign key
    
- Constraints
    
- Data types
    

---

## 3️⃣ SQL Core

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'a@b.com';
INSERT INTO orders ...
UPDATE users ...
DELETE FROM sessions ...
```

---

## 4️⃣ Indexes

You must know:

- B-Tree (default)
    
- Unique indexes
    
- Composite indexes
    

Indexes = speed.

---

## 5️⃣ Transactions

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100;
COMMIT;
```

This ensures:

- No money disappears
    
- No partial updates
    

---

# 🧠 PostgreSQL Intermediate

## 6️⃣ Joins

```
INNER
LEFT
RIGHT
FULL
```

Used for:

- User → Orders
    
- Products → Reviews
    

---

## 7️⃣ Constraints

|Type|Purpose|
|---|---|
|NOT NULL|Required|
|UNIQUE|No duplicates|
|CHECK|Validation|
|FOREIGN KEY|Relations|

---

## 8️⃣ Views

Saved queries:

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;
```

---

# 🧠 PostgreSQL Advanced (Senior Level)

## 9️⃣ MVCC (Concurrency Control)

Postgres uses:

> Multi-Version Concurrency Control

This means:

- Readers don’t block writers
    
- Writers don’t block readers
    

Critical for high concurrency.

---

## 10️⃣ Query Planner

Postgres decides:

- Which index to use
    
- Which join order
    
- Which scan method
    

Use:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
```

to debug slow queries.

---

## 11️⃣ Advanced Indexes

|Index|Used for|
|---|---|
|GIN|JSON, full text|
|GiST|Geo, ranges|
|BRIN|Huge tables|
|Partial|Filtered|
|Covering|Performance|

---

## 12️⃣ JSONB

Postgres can store:

```json
{ "theme": "dark", "lang": "en" }
```

And query it:

```sql
WHERE settings->>'theme' = 'dark'
```

This makes it both SQL & NoSQL.

---

## 13️⃣ Locks & Deadlocks

Postgres locks:

- Rows
    
- Tables
    
- Indexes
    

Bad design = deadlocks & downtime.

---

## 14️⃣ Replication & Scaling

Postgres scales via:

- Read replicas
    
- Logical replication
    
- Partitioning
    
- Sharding (Citus)
    

---

## 15️⃣ Partitioning

Split tables by:

- Date
    
- Region
    
- User
    

Improves:

- Query speed
    
- Maintenance
    
- Data lifecycle
    

---

## 16️⃣ Backup & Recovery

You must know:

- WAL
    
- PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery)
    
- Hot backups
    

This is how banks survive disasters.

---

## 17️⃣ Extensions

Postgres can become:

- Full-text search
    
- Vector database
    
- Time-series DB
    
- Geo DB
    

Using:

```
PostGIS
pgvector
Timescale
```

---

# 🏆 Senior Engineer Level

You are senior when you understand:

- How Postgres stores data on disk
    
- How vacuum works
    
- How indexes get bloated
    
- How to design schemas for scale
    
- How to handle millions of rows
    

---

# 🧠 Final truth

PostgreSQL is not “just SQL”.

It is:

> **A full-scale data platform**

Mastering it puts you in the **top 5% of backend engineers worldwide** 🚀
