# Laws of Power
Author: Robert Greene

## Preface

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Niccolò Machiavelli</mark> wrote, “Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.”

Machiavelli’s quote means that someone who always acts morally will be seen as weak and ineffective by those who are bad. It’s a warning against striving for perfection – focusing solely on being good will ultimately lead to failure in a world of flawed people

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Napoleon</mark> advised: Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove

Napoleon’s quote, “Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove,” refers to a strategic approach to leadership. It means to **appear calm and benevolent while secretly possessing a ruthless and commanding presence.**
(Like CO sir did while distributing certificate to Prince)

He used it to mask his true intentions and manipulate opponents by projecting an image of diplomacy and kindness while maintaining a powerful and controlling stance. It was a calculated move to gain leverage and avoid direct confrontation.

Essentially, it’s about appearing weak to appear strong.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">JOHANN VON GOETHE</mark>'s quote "The only means to gain one’s ends with people are force and cunning. Love also, they say; but that is to wait for sunshine, and life needs every moment"

statement argues that when trying to get what you want from others, you must rely on **force** (direct power, pressure) or **cunning** (strategic cleverness).

The arrow shot by the archer may or may not kill a single person. But stratagems devised by a wise man can kill even babes in the womb

a single physical blow is limited; a well‑designed strategy can cause much broader, even generational, destruction

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Francesco Vettori</mark>, an Italian diplomat, politician and writer from Florence
I thought to myself with what means, with what deceptions, with how many varied arts, with what industry a man sharpens his wits to deceive another, and through these variations the world is made more beautiful

the very act of devising and employing deception enriches human experience by stimulating wit and creativity

honoré de balzac's quote "There are no principles; there are only events. There is no good and bad, there are only circumstances. The superior man espouses events and circumstances in order to guide them. If there were principles and fixed laws, nations would not change them as we change our shirts and a man can not be expected to be wiser than an entire nation"

**Explanation**

- **No eternal principles:** Reality isn’t governed by fixed moral rules; it consists only of concrete events and the specific circumstances that surround them.
- **Good vs. bad is relative:** What counts as “good” or “evil” depends entirely on the situation, not on universal standards.
- **The superior person:** Instead of clinging to abstract laws, a wise individual understands the actual events and contexts and works _with_ them, shaping outcomes.
- **Change is constant:** If immutable principles existed, societies would never alter their laws or customs—yet nations “change their shirts” (their policies) all the time. Consequently, expecting a single person to be wiser than an entire nation that constantly rewrites its own rules is unrealistic.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Robert Greene</mark> "If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience in all things is your crucial shield"

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Robert Greene</mark> "In games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions; the impact matters more than any claimed goodwill"

---

**How to decide what to do or not?**
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Nietzsche</mark> wrote, “The value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays for it—what it costs us.”
*Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do*

## Law 1 - Never Outshine The Master

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">when I m weak</mark>**

Nicolas Fouquet - finance minister of Louis XIV (arrogant man who wanted to be the center of attention named sun king)
Jules Mazarin was prime minister who died in 1661

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Voltaire</mark>'s quote "When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top of the world. By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom"

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reversal</mark>
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful

---

## LAW 2 - Never Put Too Much Trust In Friends, Learn How To Use Enemies 

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">When I m Strong</mark>**
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DIANF DE POITIERS</mark>, 1499-1566, MISTRESS OF HENRI II OF FRANCE
*To have a good enemy, choose a friend: He knows where to strike* 

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Voltaire</mark>, 1694-1778 
*Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies*

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SUFI PROVERB</mark>
*Pick up a bee from kindness, and learn the limitations of kindness*

---

In a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, he referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in error. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them irreconcilable enemies who must be destroyed. “Why, madam,” Lincoln replied, “do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?”

---

## LAW 3 - Conceal Your Intension

*Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defence*

---

**PART I**
USE DECOYED OBJECTS OF DESIRE AND RED HERRINGS TO THROW PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT
 <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Baltasar Gracián</mark> said "Do not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today without being one. Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning"

---

It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Remember</mark>:
The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal of weapons

**PART II**
USE SMOKE SCREENS TO DISGUISE YOUR ACTIONS
*Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen of smoke to distract people attention from your real purpose*

---

“THE THIRTY-SIX STRATEGIES.” QUOTED IN THE JAPANESE <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ART OF WAR</mark>. THOMAS CLEARY, 1991 
"This means to create a front that eventually becomes imbued with an atmosphere or impression of familiarity, within which the strategist may maneuver unseen while all eyes are trained to see obvious familiarities"

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Remember</mark>: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their view in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other person’s superiority—these are perfect diversionary devices.

---

The simplest form of smoke screen is<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> facial expression</mark>. Behind a bland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt’s face. Baron James Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts behind bland smiles and nondescript looks
