description: difference between ETFs and MFs
---

ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and Mutual Funds are both investment vehicles that pool money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of assets, but they differ in how they’re traded, priced, and managed.

Here’s a clear side-by-side comparison:

---

## 1. Trading & Pricing

**ETF**

- Traded on stock exchanges (like shares)
- Price changes throughout the day
- You can buy/sell anytime during market hours

**Mutual Fund**

- Not traded on exchanges
- Priced once per day at **NAV (Net Asset Value)**
- Buy/sell orders execute after market close

---

## 2. Investment Minimums

**ETF**

- Usually no minimum beyond the price of one share
- Some brokers allow fractional shares

**Mutual Fund**

- Often requires a minimum investment (e.g., $500–$3,000)

---

## 3. Management Style

**ETF**

- Mostly **passively managed** (tracks an index like S&P 500)
- Some actively managed ETFs exist

**Mutual Fund**

- Can be **actively managed** or passive
- Active funds aim to outperform the market

---

## 4. Costs & Fees

**ETF**

- Generally lower expense ratios
- No sales loads
- Brokerage commissions may apply (often $0 now)

**Mutual Fund**

- Higher expense ratios (especially active funds)
- May include sales loads (front-end or back-end fees)

---

## 5. Tax Efficiency

**ETF**

- More tax-efficient due to in-kind creation/redemption process
- Fewer capital gains distributions

**Mutual Fund**

- Can generate capital gains distributions even if you don’t sell

---

## 6. Flexibility & Features

**ETF**

- Can use limit orders, stop orders, margin, short selling
- More flexible trading strategies

**Mutual Fund**

- Simpler, long-term investing
- No intraday trading or advanced order types

---

## 7. Transparency

**ETF**

- Holdings usually disclosed daily

**Mutual Fund**

- Holdings disclosed quarterly or semi-annually
