## What Is a Six Sigma Event?

A **Six Sigma event** has two primary meanings depending on the context:

1. **In statistics and quality management**, it refers to an extremely rare occurrence far from the average in a normal distribution, symbolizing near-perfect quality.
2. **In event management**, it is used as a brand or methodology name by companies that apply Six Sigma quality principles to deliver flawlessly executed events.

Both interpretations emphasize **precision, consistency, and minimizing defects**, whether in manufacturing processes or live event execution.
