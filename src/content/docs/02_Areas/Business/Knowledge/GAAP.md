## What Is a GAAP Metric?

A **GAAP metric** is a financial figure—such as revenue, net income, or assets—reported by a company in accordance with **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)**. GAAP is a standardized accounting framework used in the United States to ensure **consistency, transparency, and comparability** in financial reporting.

While GAAP metrics form the official, audited basis of financial statements, companies often supplement them with **non-GAAP metrics** (such as EBITDA or adjusted earnings). These alternative measures attempt to highlight core operating performance but should always be evaluated alongside GAAP results.

## What Is GAAP?

### Definition
GAAP is a common set of accounting rules, standards, and procedures established by the **Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)** for U.S. public companies.

### Purpose
- Ensure financial statements are **consistent and comparable**
- Improve clarity and transparency for investors
- Enable “apples-to-apples” comparisons across companies

### Examples of GAAP Principles
- Accrual principle  
- Consistency principle  
- Matching principle  
- Full disclosure principle

## What Are GAAP Metrics?

GAAP metrics are the figures reported in a company’s **official financial statements**, all prepared according to GAAP rules:

- **Income Statement**
  - Revenue (Sales)
  - Net Income (Profit)
  - Earnings Per Share (EPS)

- **Balance Sheet**
  - Assets
  - Liabilities
  - Shareholders’ Equity

- **Cash Flow Statement**
  - Operating, investing, and financing cash flows

## What Are Non-GAAP Metrics?

### Definition
**Non-GAAP metrics** are adjusted or alternative performance measures provided in addition to GAAP figures.

### Purpose
- Offer insight into ongoing business performance
- Exclude:
  - One-time or unusual charges (e.g., restructuring costs)
  - Non-cash expenses (e.g., depreciation, amortization)

### Common Examples
- **EBITDA** – Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
- **Adjusted Net Income** – Net income excluding specific non-recurring items
- Terms such as:
  - Pro Forma Earnings
  - Core Earnings
  - Normalized Earnings

## Why the Distinction Matters

- **GAAP metrics** provide a reliable, standardized, and audited baseline for financial analysis.
- **Non-GAAP metrics** reflect management’s view of performance but:
  - Are not universally standardized
  - May exclude unfavorable items selectively

Investors should always analyze **both GAAP and non-GAAP figures together** to gain a complete and accurate understanding of a company’s financial health.

## Notes

- GAAP metrics are mandatory for U.S. public companies.
- Non-GAAP disclosures must be reconciled to GAAP figures under SEC rules.
- AI-generated financial explanations may contain inaccuracies; verify with official filings.
