# Laws of Power
Author: Robert Greene

[Book Link](/lop.pdf)


## Preface

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Niccolò Machiavelli</mark> wrote, “Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.”

Machiavelli’s quote means that someone who always acts morally will be seen as weak and ineffective by those who are bad. It’s a warning against striving for perfection – focusing solely on being good will ultimately lead to failure in a world of flawed people

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Napoleon</mark> advised: Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove

Napoleon’s quote, “Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove,” refers to a strategic approach to leadership. It means to **appear calm and benevolent while secretly possessing a ruthless and commanding presence.**
(Like CO sir did while distributing certificate to Prince)

He used it to mask his true intentions and manipulate opponents by projecting an image of diplomacy and kindness while maintaining a powerful and controlling stance. It was a calculated move to gain leverage and avoid direct confrontation.

Essentially, it’s about appearing weak to appear strong.

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">JOHANN VON GOETHE</mark>'s quote "The only means to gain one’s ends with people are force and cunning. Love also, they say; but that is to wait for sunshine, and life needs every moment"

statement argues that when trying to get what you want from others, you must rely on **force** (direct power, pressure) or **cunning** (strategic cleverness).

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">KAUTILYA</mark>, INDIAN PHILOSOPHER, THIRD CENTURY B.C
The arrow shot by the archer may or may not kill a single person. But stratagems devised by a wise man can kill even babes in the womb

a single physical blow is limited; a well‑designed strategy can cause much broader, even generational, destruction

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Francesco Vettori</mark>, an Italian diplomat, politician and writer from Florence
I thought to myself with what means, with what deceptions, with how many varied arts, with what industry a man sharpens his wits to deceive another, and through these variations the world is made more beautiful

the very act of devising and employing deception enriches human experience by stimulating wit and creativity

---

honoré de balzac's quote "There are no principles; there are only events. There is no good and bad, there are only circumstances. The superior man espouses events and circumstances in order to guide them. If there were principles and fixed laws, nations would not change them as we change our shirts and a man can not be expected to be wiser than an entire nation"

**Explanation**

- **No eternal principles:** Reality isn’t governed by fixed moral rules; it consists only of concrete events and the specific circumstances that surround them.
- **Good vs. bad is relative:** What counts as “good” or “evil” depends entirely on the situation, not on universal standards.
- **The superior person:** Instead of clinging to abstract laws, a wise individual understands the actual events and contexts and works _with_ them, shaping outcomes.
- **Change is constant:** If immutable principles existed, societies would never alter their laws or customs—yet nations “change their shirts” (their policies) all the time. Consequently, expecting a single person to be wiser than an entire nation that constantly rewrites its own rules is unrealistic.

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Robert Greene</mark> "If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience in all things is your crucial shield"

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Robert Greene</mark> "In games you do not judge your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions; the impact matters more than any claimed goodwill"

---

**How to decide what to do or not?**
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Nietzsche</mark> wrote, “The value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays for it—what it costs us.”
*Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do*

---

## LAW 1 - Never Outshine The Master

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">when I m weak</mark>**

Nicolas Fouquet - finance minister of Louis XIV (arrogant man who wanted to be the center of attention named sun king)
Jules Mazarin was prime minister who died in 1661

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Voltaire</mark>'s quote "When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top of the world. By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom"

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reversal</mark>
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful

---

## LAW 2 - Never Put Too Much Trust In Friends, Learn How To Use Enemies 

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">When I m Strong</mark>**
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DIANF DE POITIERS</mark>, 1499-1566, MISTRESS OF HENRI II OF FRANCE
*To have a good enemy, choose a friend: He knows where to strike* 

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Voltaire</mark>, 1694-1778 
*Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies*

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SUFI PROVERB</mark>
*Pick up a bee from kindness, and learn the limitations of kindness*

---

In a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, he referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in error. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them irreconcilable enemies who must be destroyed. “Why, madam,” Lincoln replied, “do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?”

---

## LAW 3 - Conceal Your Intension

*Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defence*

---

**PART I**
USE DECOYED OBJECTS OF DESIRE AND RED HERRINGS TO THROW PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT
 <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Baltasar Gracián</mark> said "Do not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today without being one. Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning"

---

It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Remember</mark>:
The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal of weapons

**PART II**
USE SMOKE SCREENS TO DISGUISE YOUR ACTIONS
*Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen of smoke to distract people attention from your real purpose*

---

“THE THIRTY-SIX STRATEGIES.” QUOTED IN THE JAPANESE <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ART OF WAR</mark>. THOMAS CLEARY, 1991 
"This means to create a front that eventually becomes imbued with an atmosphere or impression of familiarity, within which the strategist may maneuver unseen while all eyes are trained to see obvious familiarities"

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Remember</mark>: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their view in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other person’s superiority—these are perfect diversionary devices.

---

The simplest form of smoke screen is<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> facial expression</mark>. Behind a bland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt’s face. Baron James Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts behind bland smiles and nondescript looks

---

## LAW 4 - Always Say Less Than Necessary

One oft-told tale about Kissinger... involved a report that Winston Lord had worked on for days. After giving it to Kissinger, he got it back with the notation, “Is this the best you can do?” Lord rewrote and polished and finally resubmitted it; back it came with the same curt question. After redrafting it one more time—and once again getting the same question from Kissinger-Lord snapped, “Damn it, yes, it’s the best I can do. ” To which Kissinger replied: “Fine, then I guess I’ll read it this time."
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">KISSINGER. WALTER ISAACSON</mark>, 1992

Typical CO sir when WSMT report from bala aartral

---

The King (Louis XIV) maintains the most impenetrable secrecy about affairs of State. The ministers attend council meetings, but he confides his plans to them only when he has reflected at length upon them and has come to a definite decision. I wish you might see the King. His expression is inscrutable; his eyes like those of a fox. He never discusses State affairs except with his ministers in Council. When he speaks to courtiers he refers only to their respective prerogatives or duties. Even the most frivolous of his utterances has the air of being the pronouncement of an oracle
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">PRIMI VISCONTI</mark>, QUOTED IN LOUIS XIV, LOUIS BERTRAND, 1928

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Leonardo da Vinci</mark>,'s quote from 1452-1519
Oysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the crab sees one it throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot close again so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him who opens his mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the listener

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SIR WALTER RALEIGH</mark>. 1554-1618
Undutiful words of a subject do often take deeper root than the memory of ill deeds.... The late Earl of Essex told Queen Elizabeth that her conditions were as crooked as her carcass; but it cost him his head, which his insurrection had not cost him but for that speech

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Han-fei-tzu</mark>, Chinese philosopher, third century B.C
*"Never start moving your own lips and teeth before the subordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others move their lips and teeth. As they move their lips and teeth, I can thereby understand their real real intentions.... If the sovereign is not mysterious, the ministers will find opportunity to take and take. *"

#### Storytime - "I shall see"
In the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days and nights debating issues of state. They would confer, argue, make and break alliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment arrived: Two of them would be chosen to represent the different sides to Louis himself, who would decide what should be done. 
After these persons were chosen, everyone would argue some more: How should the issues be phrased? What would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him? At what time of day should the representatives approach him, and in what part of the Versailles palace? What expression should they have on their faces? Finally, after all this was settled, the fateful moment would finally arrive. 
The two men would approach Louis—always a delicate matter—and when they finally had his ear, they would talk about the issue at hand, spelling out the options in detail. Louis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face. 
Finally, when each had finished his presentation and had asked for the king’s opinion, he would look at them both and say, “I shall see.” Then he would walk away. 
The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this subject from the king—they would simply see the result, weeks later, when he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to consult them on the matter again.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cardinal de Retz</mark>, 1613-1679 
*"It is even more damaging for a minister to say foolish things than to do them"*

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reversal</mark> 
Silence can arouse suspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors,
words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any deception you might practice. By bending your listener’s ear with talk, you can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can practice deception with greater ease

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Point to Ponder</mark>
*Silence and Talking must be practice carefully, learn how to sell emotion, expression and words*

---

## LAW 5 - So Much Depends Upon Reputation - Guard It With Your Life

*In this law author talks about others perspective about you, this law works differently for senior and junior*

---

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Learning</mark>
Appear to be not caring what others think of you but do care

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cicero</mark> says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for despising it

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Friedrich Nietzsche</mark>, 1844-1900
It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation.

---

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">REVERSAL</mark>
There is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no exceptions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in itself—Oscar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since we must live in society and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation.
<u> By not caring how you are perceived, you let others decide this for you. Be the master of your fate, and also of your reputation</u>

---

## LAW 6 - Court Attention At All Cost

#### PART I: Surround your name with the sensational and scandalous

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">PIETRO ARETINO</mark>, 1492-1556
*Even when I’m railed at, I get my quota of renown*

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">INDIAN FABLE</mark>
*A name without fame is like fire without flame. There is nothing like attracting notice at any cost*

---

#pointosay
Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born with. You have to learn to attract attention, “as surely as the lodestone attracts iron.”

---

#### PART II: Create an air of mystery


*What seems enigmatic instantly draws attention. An air of mystery heightens your presence. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten*

---

*<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mata Hari</mark> was no more beautiful than many of the other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the public’s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery*

---

*Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable. By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest of ways, you will emanate an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">aura of mystery</mark>*

---

*A trick <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Marcel Duchamp</mark> played to great effect. It is all very easy to do—say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contradictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all*

---

*<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Never appear greedy for attention</mark>, then, for it signals insecurity, and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it is not in your interest to be the centre of attention. When in the presence of a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to the shadows; never compete*

---

## LAW 7 - Get Other To Do The Work For You, But Always Take The Credit

It basically means <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">never do what others can do for you</mark>, this is what businessmen do they hire people and build a team. 

---

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">REVERSAL</mark>
when taking the credit for work that others have done is not the wise course: If your power is not firmly enough established, you will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a brilliant exploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused of deception.

The example of Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon illustrates this perfectly: Kissinger masterfully let Nixon take the public credit for their China visit (knowing the truth would emerge later) while ensuring he took credit for the work of his subordinates. This balanced approach—giving credit upward while taking credit downward—is presented as the expert way to navigate organizational politics and build lasting influence

---

*Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you*

---

*success comes more from leveraging the right tools and expertise than from individual talent alone*

---

**THE BLIND HEN**
*A hen who had lost her sight, and was accustomed to scratching up the earth in search of food, although blind, still continued to scratch away most diligently. Of what use was it to the industrious fool? Another sharp-sighted hen who spared her tender feet never moved from her side, and enjoyed, without scratching, the fruit of the other’s labor. For as often as the blind hen scratched up a barley-corn, her watchful companion devoured it*
FABLES, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">GOTTHOLD LESSING</mark>, 1729-1781 

---

*<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bismarck</mark> said "Fools say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by others’ experience"*

---

## LAW 8 - Make Other People Come To You - Use Bait If Necessary 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Otto von Bismarck</mark>, 1815-1898
When I have laid bait for deer, I don’t shoot at the first doe that comes to sniff, but wait until the whole herd has gathered round

---

Good warriors make others come to them, and do not go to others. This is the principle of emptiness and fullness of others and self.
When you induce opponents to come to you, then their force is always empty; as long as you do not go to them, your force is always full. Attacking emptiness with fullness is like throwing stones on eggs. (Zhang Yu, eleventh-century commentator on The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Art of War</mark>) REVERSAL

---

Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he is controlling the situation

---

The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative, to get others to react to your moves, to keep your opponent and those around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you, you suddenly become the one controlling the situation

---

## LAW 9 - Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Baltasar Gracián</mark> remarks
*The truth is generally seen, rarely heard*

---

When aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the indirect route. As it does not attack directly and avoid challenging senior. As Mr. Varun did while getting certificate from CO.

---

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Benjamin Disraeli</mark>, 1804-1881
*Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only results*

---

"say when to lie & deceive and do when it's true"

#pointosay 
Majorly this rule says CO (Senior) is always correct
